# Core Overview

We deal with the altitude and latitude/longitude of the balloon separately (see [notes from 20131117 meeting](meeting-20131117-notes.html) "... concluded that there's no point in having and integrating velocity in the vertical direction, since all altitude models are `f(time) -> altitude`").

The basic idea is to do something along the lines of

```python
while not h(x, alt, t):
    # ODE-solve horizontally
    x_dot = f(x, alt, t)
    x += x_dot * dt

    # Update the altitude
    alt = g(t)
```

where

  - `f` is a **horizontal model** (or a combination of, see below),
  - `g` is a **altitude model**,
  - `h` is a **termination function**.

## Purity

Horizontal models, altitude models and termination functions must all be [pure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).

This is cleaner, and allows us to use more interesting integration methods if we want later.

# Horizontal models (`f`)

## Signature

```python
def f(x, alt, t):
    return x_dot
```

where

  - `x = [latitude, longitude]` (`list` of `float`s; maybe rank-1 numpy array)
  - `alt` is the altitude in metres   
    <small>TODO: perfect sphere, or different model?</small>
  - `t` is an object with attributes 
      - `now` - absolute time, (Python's `datetime.datetime`)   
        <small>Aside: this might be quite expensive to create and rarely used, so it could be worth creating this only when it's needed.</small>
      - `flight_time` - time since the prediction started, in seconds (`float`)
  - `x_dot = [lat_dot, lon_dot]` (the returned value; `list` of `float`s)
    `lat_dot` and `lon_dot` are velocities northwards and eastwards wrt. the current position, as dlat/dt / dlon/dt respectively (i.e., **not** m/s)
    <small>(There must be a better way to describe that.)</small>

As an aside on coordinates (see [notes from 20131117 meeting](meeting-20131117-notes.html)), we convert to latitude & longitude ASAP since they will (probably) be simpler to work with; and the conversion "ASAP" is so that we - as much as possible - are only working in one coordinate system throughout the code.

## Linear combination of models

We want to be able to swap "bits" of `f` out; that is, take our pick from some "**models**":

  - wind velocity,
  - something more exotic like parachute glide.

For the majority of cases, taking `f` (the function the integrator will use) as linear combinations of models, all with signature `(x, alt, t) -> x_dot`, will suffice. (Incidentally, note that a function that linearly combines models is itself a model.)

At the start, some configuration is loaded, and a function is (dynamically) created; simply put:

```python
def make_f(models): return lambda x, t: sum(model(x, t) for model in models)
```

## State

The [notes from the meeting on 2013117](meeting-20131117-notes.html) contains some remarks on how we would implement state for models, if we needed to (while keeping purity).


## Simple models

The most basic model would be a function

```python
def my_model(x, alt, t): return [1, 2]
```

## Complex models

Thanks to callable objects, we can keep the simple concept of a model being a function, but add configuration:

```python
class Model(object):
    def __init__(self, some_setting=6):
        self.some_setting = some_setting

    def __call__(self, x, alt, t):
        return [4, self.some_setting]
```

The function (just as in the simple case, really) must promise to be pure and not keep state using attributes.

# Altitude Models (`g`)

Pure functions `f(time) -> altitude`, picked from a collection including:

  - constant velocity up
  - `x^-n` down
  - floating balloon
  - "diurnal" floating model (taking into account the effects of sunlight)

# Termination functions (`h`)

We want altitude models to be (pure) functions `f(time) -> altitude`, but then the altitude model is unable to decide whether the balloon has landed in general, since (for example) you need current position to check the ground altitude.

A *termination function* `f(position) -> bool` decides if the prediction should end. For example:

  - has it clipped through the ground (landed)?
  - has it been floating for too long?

# Chaining

We may want to "chain" configurations / selections of models:

Then armed with altitude models

  - constant rate ascent
  - terminal velocity descent

... and termination conditions ...

  - burst altitude reached
  - clipped through ground / landed

... you could have the prediction

  - item 1
      - some horizontal model choices
      - constant rate ascent
      - burst altitude reached
  - item 2
      - probably the same horizontal model choices
      - terminal velocity descent
      - clipped through ground / landed

(or item 2's altitude model could be 'floating balloon').

This is essentially just asking the predictor to run two predictions, one immediately after the other, with the second using the starting time and position that the first finished at.

This accommodates more complex logic without modifying our altitude models. For example,

  - we could predict a balloon with some sort of geo-fencing-cutdown by providing the cutdown logic as the termination function to the first half of the prediction
  - we can simulate something that can drop ballast as a chain of predictions
